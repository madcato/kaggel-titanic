You're new to data science and machine learning, or looking for a simple intro to the Kaggle prediction competitions.

## Competition Description

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

In this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.

Binary classification
Python and R basics

## Froamts

### train.csv
Training data to create the model

- PassengerIdPassenger Id
- SurvivedSurvived or Not
- Pclass
- Name
- Sex
- Age
- SibSp
- Parch
- Ticket
- Fare
- Cabin
- Embarked

#### Data description
- survival	Survival	0 = No, 1 = Yes
- pclass	Ticket class	1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd
- sex	Sex	
- Age	Age in years	
- sibsp	# of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic	
- parch	# of parents / children aboard the Titanic	
- ticket	Ticket number	
- fare	Passenger fare	
- cabin	Cabin number	
- embarked	Port of Embarkation	C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton

##### Variable Notes

pclass: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
1st = Upper
2nd = Middle
3rd = Lower

age: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5

sibsp: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc√©s were ignored)

parch: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
Parent = mother, father
Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson
Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.

### test.csv
Test data to check the accuracy of the model created

- PassengerId
- Pclass
- Name
- Sex
- Age
- SibSp
- Parch
- Ticket
- Fare
- Cabin
- Embarked

### gender_submission.csv
Demographics and Travel attributes

- PassengerId
- Survived

#### Submission File Format

You should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond PassengerId and Survived) or rows.

The file should have exactly 2 columns:

PassengerId (sorted in any order)
Survived (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased):

	PassengerId,Survived
	 892,0
	 893,1
	 894,0
	 Etc.
